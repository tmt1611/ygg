# Project : Yggdrasil v3.0 - The World Tree

An AI-powered web application for designing, visualizing, and collaboratively editing tech trees, skill trees, and other complex hierarchical tree graphs using Gemini and D3.js.

## Running the Application

This is a fully client-side web application. To run it, you need a simple local web server to serve the files to your browser.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.

### Instructions

1.  **Start the Server:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this project, and run the provided server script:

    ```bash
    python3 serve.py
    ```

    On Linux or macOS, you can optionally make the script executable first for a shorter command:
    ```bash
    chmod +x serve.py
    ./serve.py
    ```

2.  **Access the App:**
    The server will start, and you will see a message in your terminal like:
    ```
    Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8080
    ```
    Open the link `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) to use the application.

3.  **Stop the Server:**
    To stop the server, go back to your terminal window and press `Ctrl+C`.

That's it! The application runs entirely in your browser. No other setup is required.
